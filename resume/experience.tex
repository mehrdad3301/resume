\begin{onecolentry}
	I'm working on backdoor attacks under the supervision of Dr. Rohban and Dr. Soleymani. We've developed a simple multi-trigger attack that can bypass Anti-Backdoor Learning, a state-of-the-art defense. Currently, we are testing our attack against other defenses, and we hope to publish the results soon.

	\textbf{Amirkabir University}
	\textit{Undergraduate Research Assistant}
\end{twocolentry}


\begin{onecolentry}
	Studied machine learning with graphs under the supervision of Dr. Rahmati.
	During this time, I learned about graph neural network architectures and gained hands-on experience by implementing them in Pytorch. Furthermore, I studied knowledge graph embeddings and their applications within drug interaction networks.

	\textbf{Snapp}
	\textit{Software Engineer}
\end{twocolentry}


\begin{onecolentry}
	Snapp is the leading company in providing online taxi services with over 30 million users in Iran. As part of the Routing team, we were responsible for providing estimated time of arrival (ETA) and navigation services. 
	
	\begin{highlights}
		\item Added a post-processing procedure to the map matching algorithm, which significantly improved coverage.
		\item Integrated traffic speeds into routing algorithms, enabling time-dependent routing. 
		\item Redesigned ETA benchmarking service leveraging concurrency, which increased  throughput by x10.
